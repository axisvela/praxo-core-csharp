# PRAXO-CORE for C#

PRAXO-CORE is an embeddable, MIT-licensed agent framework. This package is its native .NET Core: an agent loop with tool registration and dispatch, policy hooks, typed events, memory, checkpoints, context budgets, middleware, JSON Schema validation, and plugin manifest parsing. It runs in-process and does not require a hosted service.

## Quick start

Install the published package:

```bash
dotnet add package Praxo.Core --version 0.8.0
```

```csharp
using Praxo.Core;

var model = new StaticModel("hello");
var agent = new Agent(new AgentOptions(model));
var result = agent.Run(new Session("demo"), "hello");
Console.WriteLine(result.Output);
```

## Examples

Runnable examples live under [`language/csharp/examples`](language/csharp/examples).

| Example | What it shows |
| --- | --- |
| [checkpoint](language/csharp/examples/checkpoint) | This example uses published NuGet `Praxo.Core==0.6.0` to keep checkpoint storage application-owned while using the SDK allowlist for payload encoding. |
| [event-sink](language/csharp/examples/event-sink) | This example uses published NuGet `Praxo.Core==0.6.0` to observe agent lifecycle and tool events without coupling the agent to a logging or telemetry backend. |
| [identity-policy](language/csharp/examples/identity-policy) | This example uses published NuGet `Praxo.Core==0.6.0` to bind a trusted principal to Core policy authorization. The application owns authentication and principal storage; Core o... |
| [mcp](language/csharp/examples/mcp) | This example uses published NuGet `Praxo.Core==0.6.0` with an in-process MCP transport. It exercises the same `initialize`, `tools/list`, and `tools/call` flow as a stdio sessio... |
| [provider-fallback](language/csharp/examples/provider-fallback) | This example uses published NuGet `Praxo.Core==0.6.0` to fall back to a second model when the primary model call fails. |
| [retry](language/csharp/examples/retry) | This example uses published NuGet `Praxo.Core==0.6.0` to retry transient model failures without changing the agent loop. |
| [service](language/csharp/examples/service) | This example embeds published NuGet `Praxo.Core==0.6.0` in a standard-library TCP/HTTP service. The application supplies a principal and tenant, restricts tools, and returns JSON. |
| [streaming](language/csharp/examples/streaming) | This example uses published NuGet `Praxo.Core==0.6.0` to consume deltas while the agent loop keeps running normally. |
| [structured-output](language/csharp/examples/structured-output) | This example uses published NuGet `Praxo.Core==0.6.0` to turn free text into validated JSON with `StructuredOutput`. |

## Verify

Run the checks from `language/csharp`:

```bash
dotnet build language/csharp/Praxo.Core/Praxo.Core.csproj
dotnet run --project language/csharp/Praxo.Conformance
dotnet run --project language/csharp/Praxo.Tests
dotnet run --project language/csharp/Praxo.Conformance -- --check-api
dotnet run --project language/csharp/samples/VbSample
```

This mirror contains the language source and the shared `spec/` vectors, so the implementation can be built and tested here. See [`language/csharp/README.md`](language/csharp/README.md) for the exact commands. The monorepo CI runs conformance, API snapshot, and native tests for this implementation.
